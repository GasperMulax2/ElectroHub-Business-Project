## ⚙️ Process

### 1. Identify Business Requirements
The first step was to define the key business questions and performance indicators (KPIs) that the dashboard needed to answer. These included tracking top and bottom products by sales, profit, and quantity, analyzing trends over time, comparing performance between periods, and examining sales by city and discount categories.

### 2. Load Data into Power BI
An Excel file (`.xlsx`) containing ElectroHub’s store data was imported into **Power BI Desktop**. The dataset included details on products, sales, customers, and transactions.

### 3. Data Profiling and Transformation
Data profiling and cleaning were performed using the **Power Query Editor**. This step involved:
- Inspecting column statistics to detect missing or invalid values.  
- Removing errors and duplicates to ensure data consistency.  
- Verifying that all `CustomerID` values were distinct and valid.  
- Correcting data types (e.g., dates, numeric fields, and text fields) to ensure smooth analysis and accurate visualizations.  
- Renaming columns for clarity and standardizing field names.  
- Creating a new field, `PromotionID`, to serve as a unique primary key for promotions.  

### 4. Data Modeling
In **Model View**, tables were connected using appropriate relationships to form a **Star Schema**.  
This included:
- Defining **primary and foreign keys** between fact and dimension tables.  
- Setting **cardinality** (one-to-many or many-to-one) and enforcing referential integrity.  
- Ensuring logical relationships that accurately reflect business rules.  

### 5. Filtering and Interactivity
The dashboard utilized different types of filters in the **Filters pane** to enable dynamic user interaction.  
This included:
- Page-level, visual-level, and report-level filters.  
- Adjusting filter behavior for dimension tables to ensure accurate slicing across visuals.  
- Implementing slicers and visual filters for categories such as time period, product category, and region.

### 6. Dashboard Development
Multiple visuals were created to represent insights effectively:
- Area charts for sales trends.  
- Bar and column charts for top/bottom product analysis.  
- A table with different filters (Filter by date, customer name, promotion name, etc).  
- Card visuals and KPIs for total orders.
- Maps for city-wise Netsales distribution.  

This structured process ensured that the **ElectroHub Power BI Dashboard** was both visually engaging and analytically powerful, allowing users to explore data intuitively and make informed decisions.
